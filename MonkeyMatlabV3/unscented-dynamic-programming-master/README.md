# unscented-dynamic-programming

A trajectory optimization algorithm that doesn't require dynamics derivatives.

This is an example MATLAB implementation of the algorithm in the following paper:

Zachary Manchester and Scott Kuindersma, "[Derivative-Free Trajectory Optimization with Unscented Dynamic Programming](http://agile.seas.harvard.edu/publications/derivative-free-trajectory-optimization-unscented-dynamic-programming)," 55th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), December, 2016.

To get started, try running the demo scripts.
